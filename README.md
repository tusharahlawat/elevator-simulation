# Elevator Simulation System

## Overview
This is a Python-based elevator simulation system using Tkinter for GUI visualization. It supports multiple elevators with different request handling algorithms (First-Come-First-Serve and Nearest Lift Selection). Users can make external and internal elevator requests and visualize elevator movement in real-time.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter
- **Two elevators** moving between floors
- **Two request handling algorithms**:
  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Nearest lift selection
- **User controls** for calling elevators and making internal requests
- **Real-time visualization** of elevator movement

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tusharahlawat/elevator-simulation.git
   cd elevator-simulation
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (Tkinter is included with Python):
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```

## Usage
Run the script using:
```sh
python elevator_simulation.py
```

### Controls
- Set the number of floors.
- Call an elevator to a floor with a specific direction (up/down).
- Request an internal floor selection from within an elevator.
- Switch between FCFS and Nearest algorithms dynamically.
